haproxy-ec2
===========

Monitors the status of a haproxy instance sitting in front of a cluster of servers running on EC2 and starts/stops them according to the observed load.

This is the code I have written to run the experiments described in the paper "Empirical Evaluation of Power Saving Policies for Data Centers", published at ACM Greenmentrics 2012,
